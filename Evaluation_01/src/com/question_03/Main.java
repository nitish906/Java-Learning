 Q3) Write a Java class with a static method that will take 5 positive numbers as a 
	 parameter which will represent:
	 1s, 2s, 3s, fours and sixes scored by the batsman.
	● implement the static runScored method to compute the total run scored by that batsman.
	● Call this method from the main method of that class and print the result.
	
	public class Main {
	public static void runScored(int one, int two, int three, int four ,int six) {
	 // write your logic here
	}
	public static void main(String[] args){
	b//call runScored with valid parameters
	}
}

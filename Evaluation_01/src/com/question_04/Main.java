/*
 Q3) Create a class Lion with following members:

	String name;
	boolean isHungry;
	int age;
	static int totalDeaths;
	static printKillings() : void
	thinking() : void
	printKillings() should print this ("Total killings by lions in jungle = "+totalDeaths);
	Implement thinking() in the following manner-
	● if isHungry=false then print LionName is sleeping;
	● if isHungry=true and age>12 then increase the totalDeaths by two and print lionName has eaten two
	animal
	● if isHungry=true and age<=12 and age >=2 then increase the totalDeaths by one and print lionName
	has eaten one animal
	● if isHungry=true and age<=2 then print lionName is calling Mom;
	Inside main method of Lion
	Make 3 objects(lion1, lion2, lion3) of class Lion and assign valid values to variables and call
	thinking() for each object.
	then print totalDeaths by calling printKillings() ;
	
	Sample output-
	lion1 has killed two animal
	
	lion2 has killed one animal
	lion3 is sleeping
	Total Killings by lion in jungle 3
	Note: This output is just for reference, you can assign any value to the lion object.

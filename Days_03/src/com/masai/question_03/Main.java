 Create a Student class with the following fields:
		roll: Integer
		name: String
		address: String
		collageName: String
		Include appropriate getter methods
		Create a static method inside this class as follows:
		public static Student getStudent(boolean isFromNIT)
		Assume most of the students are from “NIT” college. So the user has to call the above
		method by passing true or false input whether the student is from NIT or not.
		1. If the student belongs to NIT, then create a student object with a 3-argument
		constructor to initialize the values for (roll, name, address) and set the collageName
		as “NIT” and return that Student object.
		2. If the student belongs to another college, create the student object with a 4-
	argument constructor to initialize all the values and return that Student object.

Call the above method from the main method of the Demo class 2 times and print both
the Student details.
